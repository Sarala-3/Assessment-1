This website is about the color yellow and how it contrasts so well with the color black.
It is also about the color black and how it contrasts so well with the color yellow.

- It is very simple.
- I tried to keep everything as neat as possible. 
- Used google A LOT. I mainly used the w3 page.
- Struggled a little with margins and padding, but figured it out.
- Wanted everything centered and experimented with percentages instead of pixels (margins,paddings,width of image)
- I added a font from google fonts. Followed the instructions and I'm pretty happy with the result.
- Named everything according to the page it belonged to: 'y' for yellow page and 'b' for the black page.
- I used the comments in the css sheet to separate everything into 3 sections: What affects both pages, what affects the yellow page and what affects the black page.
- A very high contrasting page.
- It's easy to use.

Enjoy!
